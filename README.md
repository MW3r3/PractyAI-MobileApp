# PractyAI_ReactNative_Deprecated

PractyAI began as an enterprising startup aimed at revolutionizing language learning through the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our core initiative was to build a dynamic and intelligent chatbot capable of assisting language learners by offering advanced features like spell checking, flexible personas, and conversational engagement.

## Vision and Endeavor
Our aspiration was to transcend typical chatbot interactions by tapping into the sophisticated capabilities of LLMs, facilitating a learning experience akin to conversing with a human tutor. Originally developed using Flask, our ambition evolved toward creating a more accessible and ubiquitous platform. Hence, we transitioned to React Native with the intent to roll out a mobile application that could operate seamlessly across various devices.

With an emphasis on convenience and user experience, the React Native app aimed to integrate PractyAI into widely-used messaging services such as WhatsApp. This strategy was driven by our understanding that language learning is most effective when integrated smoothly into a user's daily routine.

## Candid Reflections on Our Journey
Despite our enthusiasm and unwavering commitment, PractyAI faced significant challenges that ultimately led to us not achieving our set objectives, resulting in the discontinuation of the startup. The journey of PractyAI—both its promising beginnings and its untimely conclusion—has been a deeply informative experience.

The cessation of our React Native-powered application signifies not just an end but also a beginning; it is an opportunity for introspection and recalibration as we carry valuable lessons learned into future pursuits.

## Project Status Announcement
It is with a sense of candid acceptance that we inform all stakeholders and followers that PractyAI's React Native application is deprecated. It currently stands inactive, with no future development or updates anticipated.

While PractyAI did not materialize as hoped, it remains a poignant reminder of the boldness required in startup culture—where risk-taking is inherent and each setback paves the way for new understanding and eventual success in the innovative landscape of EdTech.
